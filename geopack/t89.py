    Computes GSM components of the magnetic field produced by extra-
    terrestrial current systems in the geomagnetosphere. The model is
    valid up to geocentric distances of 70 Re and is based on the merged
    IMP-A,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J (1966-1974), HEOS-1 and -2 (1969-1974),
    and ISEE-1 and -2  spacecraft data set.

    This is a modified version (t89c), which replaced the original one
    in 1992 and differs from it in the following:
    (1) ISEE-1,2 data were added to the original IMP-HEOS dataset
    (2) Two terms were added to the original tail field modes, allowing
        a modulation of the current by the geodipole tilt angle

    :param iopt: specifies the ground disturbance level:
        iopt= 1       2        3        4        5        6      7
                   correspond to:
        kp=  0,0+  1-,1,1+  2-,2,2+  3-,3,3+  4-,4,4+  5-,5,5+  &gt =6-
    :param parmod: dummy variable.
    :param ps: geo-dipole tilt angle in radius.
    :param x,y,z: GSM coordinates in Re (1 Re = 6371.2 km)
    :return: bx,by,bz. Field components in GSM system, in nT.

    This release of t89c is dated  Feb 12, 1996;
    Last update: May 9, 2006; a save statement was added in the subroutine t89c, to avoid runtime problems on some fortran compilers

    tail current sheet) + a modification added in April 1992 (see below)

    Model formulas for the magnetic field components contain in total
    30 free parameters (17 linear and 13 nonlinear parameters).

    Linear parameters:
        a[0]-a[1]: correspond to contribution from the tail current system
        a[2]-a[3]: the amplitudes of symmetric and antisymmetric terms in the contribution from the closure currents
        a[4]: the ring current amplitude
        a[5]-a[14]: define Chapman-Ferraro+Birkeland current field.
            The coefficients c16-c19  (see Formula 20 in the original paper), due to DivB=0
            condition, are expressed through a[5]-a[14] and hence are not independent ones.
        a[15]-a[16]: the terms which yield the tilt angle dependence of the tail current intensity (added on April 9, 1992)

    Nonlinear parameters:
        a[17]: dx - characteristic scale of the Chapman-Ferraro field along the x-axis
        a[18]: ADR (aRC) - Characteristic radius of the ring current
        a[19] : D0 - Basic half-thickness of the tail current sheet
        a[20] : DD (GamRC)- defines rate of thickening of the ring current, as we go from night- to dayside
        a[21] : Rc - an analog of "hinging distance" entering formula (11)
        a[22] : G - amplitude of tail current warping in the Y-direction
        a[23] : aT - Characteristic radius of the tail current
        a[24] : Dy - characteristic scale distance in the Y direction entering in W(x,y) in (13)
        a[25] : Delta - defines the rate of thickening of the tail current sheet in the Y-direction (in T89 it was fixed at 0.01)
        a[26] : Q - this parameter was fixed at 0 in the final version of T89; initially it was introduced for making Dy to depend on X
        a[27] : Sx (Xo) - enters in W(x,y) ; see (13)
        a[28] : Gam (GamT) - enters in DT in (13) and defines rate of tail sheet thickening on going from night to dayside; in T89 fixed at 4.0
